[00:11.62] His smile fresh as spring as towards him he draws you
[00:26.37] His Tongue sharp and silvery, as he implores you
[00:35.79] Your wishes he grants as he swears to adore you
[00:48.20] Gold, silver, jewels he lays riches before you
[01:03.01] Dues need be repaid and he will come for you
[01:15.22] All to reclaim no smile to console you
[01:24.22] He'll snare you in bonds eyes glowin' afire |
[01:35.20] To gore and torment you 'til the stars expire
