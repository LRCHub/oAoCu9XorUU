Well I've been gifted, but you'll never know
I've got special powers beyond your control
If I've got problems, well, I'll never share
I'll work them out slowly, you won't be there

Something within me, I feel it inside
Serving no purpose, just along for the ride
Better run and hide

Charging headlong into volcanoes
With fearless abandon, lay down in the road
I thank the heavens for gifting me so
Gifting me powers, beyond your control

You were once the brightest star in my firmament
Came crashing down

Once you were the brightest star of all
